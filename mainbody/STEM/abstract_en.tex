In this paper, the detection of hand motion direction is performed for the video files acquired by cell phone camera. Aiming at the characteristics of low-end camera video images, this paper adopts a method based on background removal and skin color model to detect the hand region and to discriminate the direction of hand motion.

Firstly, a video image sequence is acquired, i.e., each frame from the video file is acquired as a video image sequence to be detected; secondly, each frame in the acquired video image sequence is preprocessed with color model conversion, background removal, image binarization, morphological processing, etc.; then, a region growing method is used to detect the hand connectivity region in the video image sequence and to calculate the center of the hand region in each frame; finally, the hand region is detected based on the color model in the image sequence and the direction of hand movement is detected based on the color model. The center of the hand region; finally, the hand movement direction is judged based on the change of the center position of the hand region in the image sequence.

In this paper, under Visual c++6.0 development environment, with the help of OpenCV open platform, we designed and realized the hand gesture motion detection system based on low-end camera video, and got a better detection effect.
